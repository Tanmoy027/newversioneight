# Database Operation Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified

### 1. Silent Error Handling
- The `safeQuery` function was returning `null` on errors instead of throwing them
- This caused operations to fail silently without proper error messages
- Users would see "Processing..." but nothing would happen

### 2. Missing User Profiles
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies require user profiles to exist in the `profiles` table
- Some users might not have profiles created automatically
- This would cause all database operations to fail due to RLS restrictions

### 3. Poor Error Reporting
- Errors were being logged as warnings instead of errors
- Error messages weren't being properly propagated to the user interface
- Console logs were insufficient for debugging

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `lib/supabase.js`
- Changed `console.warn` to `console.error` for better visibility
- Added proper error propagation instead of returning `null`
- Improved connection error detection
- Added detailed error logging

### 2. User Profile Management
- Created `ensureUserProfile()` function to automatically create missing profiles
- Added profile verification before database operations
- Handles cases where the signup trigger didn't create a profile

### 3. Cart Page Improvements (`app/cart/page.jsx`)
- Added profile existence check before order placement
- Removed `safeQuery` wrapper for direct error handling
- Improved error messages with specific details
- Better console logging for debugging

### 4. Account Page Improvements (`app/account/page.jsx`)
- Added profile existence check before updates
- Enhanced error handling for profile updates
- Better synchronization between auth metadata and profiles table
- Improved user feedback

### 5. Auth Hook Improvements (`hooks/useAuth.js`)
- Added automatic profile creation during user session initialization
- Better error handling for missing profiles
- Improved profile fetching reliability

## Testing

### To Test Order Placement:
1. Sign in to your account
2. Add items to cart
3. Go to cart page
4. Fill in shipping address and phone number
5. Click "Place Order"
6. Check browser console for detailed logs
7. Should see success message and redirect to orders page

### To Test Account Updates:
1. Sign in to your account
2. Go to account page
3. Click "Edit" button
4. Update your information
5. Click "Save"
6. Check browser console for detailed logs
7. Should see success message

## Browser Console Monitoring

The fixes include extensive console logging. Open browser developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab to see:
- Profile verification steps
- Database operation results
- Detailed error messages if something fails
- Success confirmations

## Database Schema Requirements

Ensure these tables exist with proper RLS policies:
- `profiles` (with phone and address columns)
- `orders`
- `order_items`
- `products`
- `categories`

The fixes handle missing profiles automatically, but the database schema must be properly set up.
